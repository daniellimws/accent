title: T19 Challenge (Part 3)
---

This is the third part of the writeup for the [T19 Challenge](http://t19challenge.com), and here is [part 1][part1] and [part 2][part2].

Previously, we managed to gain shell access to the server as the user `rubyist`, by being able to execute arbitrary commands through the web application. After that, we exploited a buffer overflow in the `dbclient` binary to escalate priviledges as user `ben`. In this part, we will exploit a buffer overflow in the virus database service.

### Reverse Engineering
#### Downloading the binary
Earlier, it was said that they heard `ben` was working on the running server, which would be `srv_copy` found in `ben`'s home directory.

```bash
rubyist@t19-deployment-7b944c57cb-h5vjr:~$ ls -al /home/ben
total 60
drwxr-xr-x 1 ben  ben   4096 Jan 15 16:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 26 15:26 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben  ben    220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben  ben   3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-r----S--- 1 ben  ben     24 Nov 29 15:00 .flag.advanced
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben  ben    675 May 15  2017 .profile
-rws---r-x 1 ben  ben  14872 Dec 17 18:01 dbclient
-r-------- 1 ben  ben  14552 Jan 15 16:19 srv_copy
```

We can download the binary using the method describe in [part 2][part2-downloading].

#### Analysing the binary
Here is the pseudocode for `srv_copy`.

```c
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{  
  char message[269];
  while ( 1 )
  {
    fd = start_server("secretSock");
    if ( !fd )
      break;

    if ( fd > 0 )
    {
      while (read_message(fd, message))
      {
        switch(message.code) 
        {
        case 1:
          respond_client(fd, 1, 0);
          break;

        case 2:
          char check_hash_result = check_hash(&message.data, &buf);  // buf is in the .bss section
          respond_client(fd, check_hash_result, 0LL);
          break;

        case 3:
          char* hash_ptr = get_hash((long long) message.data);
          respond_client(fd, 1, hash_ptr);
          break;
          
        case 4:
          char read_result = read_secret();
          respond_client(fd, read_result, &secret);
          break;
        }
      }
      puts("server done with client.");
      close_fd(fd);
    }
    else
    {
      fwrite("server can't start\n", 1uLL, 0x13uLL, stderr);
    }
  }
  cleanup();
  puts("server quit.");
  return 0LL;
}
```

In the previous part the implementation details of the client-server communication was omitted. For this part we need to reverse engineer it so that we can write our own custom client to attack the server.

Running `dbclient` with `strace`, the socket api function calls can be easily identified. The program creates a UNIX domain socket, and we can easily replicate it.

```c
const char* socketname = "secretSock";
int fd = socket(1, 1, 0);

struct sockaddr_un addr;
memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
strncpy(addr.sun_path + 1, socketname, strlen(socketname));

if (connect(fd, (struct sockaddr *) &addr, sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen("secretSock") + 1) == -1) {
    puts("failed connect");
    return -1;
}

// http://man7.org/tlpi/code/online/dist/sockets/us_abstract_bind.c.html
```

*During the challenge, I just used `13` which was the value I got from `strace`, instead of `sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen("secretSock") + 1`. Only after the CTF I decided to document the proper usage here.*

##### UNIX domain sockets
Unlike TCP sockets that allow communicating with other devices over the internet, which we are more familiar with, UNIX domain sockets allow for communication between processes on the same machine.

http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html
> The AF_UNIX (also known as AF_LOCAL) socket family is used to communicate between processes on the same machine efficiently. Traditionally, UNIX domain sockets can be either unnamed, or **bound to a filesystem pathname** (marked as being of type socket). **Linux also supports an abstract namespace which is independent of the filesystem.**

You may have noticed that one byte was skipped in `strncpy(addr.sun_path + 1, ...)`. This is to indicate the usage of an abstract namespace. Otherwise, a typical UNIX domain socket would create a file that actually appears in the filesystem, which would be troublesome to connect considering it is bound to a filesystem pathname.

More information could be found [here](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SocketAbstractNamespace).

#### Message format
##### Client
The server receives a 269-byte buffer from the client, which can be represented by the following `struct`.

```c
struct ClientMessage
{
  long long checksum;   // an adler32 checksum is computed and stored here
  char dummy[5];        // this is the same throughout all requests and is not processed by the server
  char code;            // request code
  char[255] data;       // could be a string or an integer
}
```

```c
void request_server(int fd, char code, char *data)
{
  struct ClientMessage s;

  memset(&s, 0, 269);
  memcpy(&s.dummy, "DA777", 5);

  s.code = code;
  if (data)
  {
    memcpy(&s.data, data, 255);
  }

  long long checksum_init = adler32(0, 0, 0);
  s.checksum = adler32(checksum_init, &s, 269);

  write(fd, s, 269);
}
```

Each `ClientMessage` contains a request code to indicate the operation performed by the server, followed by a generous 255-byte buffer of data. Just before the client sends the message, it will compute a checksum and store it in the message itself. 

When the server receives the message, it first computes a checksum of the message and compare it with the sent checksum. This is to verify that the message is sent from `dbclient` itself.

##### Server
The server responds the client with a 255-byte buffer.

```c
struct ServerResponse
{
  char result;      // 0 or 1
  char[255] data;
}
```

```c
void respond_client(int fd, char result, char *data)
{
  struct ServerResponse s;
  memset(&s, 0, 256);
  s.result = result;

  if (data)
  {
    memcpy(&s.data, data, 255);
  }

  write(fd, s, 256);
}
```

The response by the server is slightly simpler, with just 1 byte indicating the result and 255 bytes of data following it.

#### Troublesome read and write
Request codes 2 and 3 contain vulnerabities that could be used to perform a write and read, respectively.

```c
case 2:
  char check_hash_result = check_hash(&message.data, &buf);  // buf is in the .bss section
  respond_client(fd, check_hash_result, 0LL);
  break;

case 3:
  char* hash_ptr = get_hash((long long) message.data);
  respond_client(fd, 1, hash_ptr);
  break;
```

##### Write
Let's look at the write vulnerability in `check_hash` first.

```c
void init_db()
{
  if (db)
    return 1;

  fd = open("/opt/db/base", 0);
  fstat(1, fd, &stat_buf);
  len = stat_buf.st_size;
  db = mmap(0LL, stat_buf.st_size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
  close(fd);
}
```

```c
int check_hash(char* input, char* buf)
{
  char dest[32];
  int index;
  char* copy_buf;

  init_db();

  index = 0;
  copy_buf = buf;
  strcpy(&dest, input);
  do
  {
    strcpy(copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0, &db[index]);
    if (!memcmp(&dest, copy_buf, 0x20))
      return 1;
    index += 0x21;
  }
  while (db[index]);
  return 0;
}
```

*<center>Error-checking code was omitted for simplificity</center>*
<br/>

With `message.code` set to 2, the program first calls `init_db()` to map the contents of `opt/db/base` into memory, and saves the address into the global variable `db`. A check is made to ensure this is only ran once.

Our sent `message.data` is copied into a variable on the stack, `dest`. After that, 20 bytes will be copied from `db` into `copy_buf`, which is then compared with the contents in `dest`. The `index` is incremented by `0x21` (includes the null byte), and the process above is repeated until we get a match, or there is nothing left in `db`.

The line that catches my attention is `strcpy(&dest, input)`. By overflowing the buffer in `dest`, we can overwrite the variables `index` (where to copy from), and `copy_buf` (where to write to). The only constraint here is there cannot be null bytes present in the new `index`, or `strcpy` wouldn't overwrite the contents of `copy_buf`.

##### Read
Moving on, let's look at the read vulnerability in `get_hash`.

```c
char *get_hash(unsigned long long index)
{
  return &db[0x21 * index];
}
```

With `message.code` set to 3, we can send an integer in `message.data` to specify the `index` of the `db` to read from. Except that there is no boundary checking made.

Simple enough, we can provide a large `index` to read other unintended parts of memory. One problem here is the `0x21` multiplier being applied, which is kind of limiting. 

I overcame this by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of `0x21` under modulo `2**64`, i.e. finding a value `x` such that `(x * 0x21) % (2 ** 64) == 1`, so that I can specify the exact offset to read from (since everything above 8 bytes is truncated during multiplication).

```c
// since 1117984489315730401 * 0x21 = 1
// 0x21 * 1117984489315730401 * offset = offset
index = 1117984489315730401 * offset;
// db[0x21 * index] = db[offset]
```

Alternatively, as the server copies all 255 bytes from the pointer returned by `get_hash` into the response, instead of using `strcpy` which stops once reaching a null byte, one can also just extract from the desired offset after reading from the server. (I believe so, but may be wrong as I didn't check.)

##### Secret
```c
void read_secret()
{
  init_db();

  if (*db)
  {
    fd = open("/opt/db/.flag.pwn", 0);
    read(fd, &secret, 0xFF);
    close(fd);
  }
  else
  {
    memset(&secret, 0, 0xFF);
  }
}
```

With `message.code` set to 4, the server checks if `db` is empty. If so, it reads the flag into a global variable `secret`, which will then be sent to the client as response.

Seeing this and the challenge description to **empty their database**, it is clear that our task is to overwrite the first byte in `db` to a null byte, so that effectively the database is "emptied".

### Exploit
Now the attack plan is straightforward. Find out where is `db`, then overwrite it with a null byte.

#### Finding `db`
This part took me a few hours, as I went down the completely wrong path of trying to locate the address of the `ld` section by scanning the stack for specific bytes, then subtracting with supposed offsets, as the `ld` section is "close" to `db` when inspecting with `gdb`. This was really unproductive as the challenge server probably had mapped them differently from my local machine, making it hard to effectively predict how "far" they are apart.

Only after a while I decided to look at the memory page directly below `db`, and immediately found treasure.

![memory-page][memory-page-screenshot]

Knowing this, getting the address of `db` is just a matter of reading the address at offset `0x1000`, then subtracting it by `0x1050`. To ensure that this is really correct, we can read from offset `0x400000 - &db` and validate that it contains `"\x7fELF"`.

Due to the fact that `mmap` allocates a new page right above the previously allocated one, and this memory page was allocated using `mmap` by `ld` for its operations, I am quite certain that it will **always** be right below `db`, allowing us to very effectively determine the exact address of `db`.

Checking this a couple of times locally and on the challenge server proved my point.

#### Finding a null byte
We cannot just take any null byte in memory and copy it into `db`, since the program will keep copying until either `dest` matches the null byte (which makes no sense), or the next entry is also a null byte.

```c
// from check_hash
do
{
  strcpy(copy_buf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0, &db[index]);
  if (!memcmp(&dest, copy_buf, 0x20))
    return 1;
  index += 0x21;
}
while (db[index]);
```

In other words, we need to find an `address` that contains a null byte, then `address + 0x21` must also contain a null byte. Unfortunately, we cannot use the memory page mentioned earlier, despite it having an abundance of null bytes, because its offset from `db` is in the range of `0x1000` to `0x2000`, which is less than 8 bytes long, meaning that there will be null bytes when overwriting `index` in `check_hash`.

However, there are references to strings in the `ld` section in this page, which we can use to determine the address of `ld`, which has a negative offset relative to `db`. Using any address in this section would be fine, since a negative value would fill up 8 bytes in memory.

To make sure that I am looking at the same thing the server is using, I downloaded `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.24.so` from the challenge server, and started to look for the null bytes in `gdb`.

![nullbytes][nullbytes-screenshot]

A working address can be found at `ld + 0xa`.

#### Wrapping things up
Now our exploit can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Find address of `db` using the memory page directly below it.
2. Find address of `ld` using addresses in that memory page.
3. Overflow `dest` to overwrite `index` with `&db - (&ld + 0xa)`, and `copy_buf` with `db`.

The exploit code is quite long and messy, so I didn't include them here, but you can find the relevant files [here](https://github.com/daniellimws/daniellimws.github.io/tree/master/ctfs/t19/part3).

In the [next part][part4], we take one step further and exploit the server to get a `root` shell.
