```sh
PS S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5> .\ctf.exe
You forgot the colour of my favourite potato! >:E
```

I loaded the program into Ghidra for analysis, and it took quite long (a few minutes) to complete. The file size is 12.6MB. Normally when a binary that doesn't even do much is so large, it is because it is either statically-compiled, or some runtime in embedded in the binary.

For example, some commonly known ones are Go or Rust programs.

Looking at the strings in the binary, we can identify that this is a racket-lang program. For example, we can find the following strings:

```text
racket [<option> ...] <argument> ...
http://docs.racket-lang.org/local-redirect/index.htmlZget-doc-open-url
http://planet.racket-lang.org/servlets/planet-servlet.ss"
```

The next step is to watch some Racket lang tutorials:
* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq25PHiRVfM)
* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4erGqF1Da8)

### Where is the program?

I tried searching for the program entry point in the binary, by searching for references to the string `"You forgot the colour of my favourite potato!"`, but could not find anything. However, from searching for references to `printf`, I found a function that prints the following message.

```sh
racket [<option> ...] <argument> ...
 File and expression options:
  -e <exprs>, --eval <exprs> : Evaluate <exprs>, prints results
  -f <file>, --load <file> : Like -e '(load "<file>")' without printing
  -t <file>, --require <file> : Like -e '(require (file "<file>"))' [*]
  -l <path>, --lib <path> : Like -e '(require (lib "<path>"))' [*]
  -p <package> : Like -e '(require (planet "<package>")' [*]
  -r <file>, --script <file> : Same as -f <file> -N <file> --
  -u <file>, --require-script <file> : Same as -t <file> -N <file> --
  -k <n> <m> <p> : Load executable-embedded code from offset <n> to <p>
  -m, --main : Call `main' with command-line arguments, print results
  ...
```

I think it is possible that the Racket lang runtime is embedded in the binary, and the program bytecode is loaded by the runtime, in order to run the actual program.

I verified my claims with the documentation for [`raco exe`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html).

> Compiled code produced by raco make relies on Racket executables to provide run-time support to the compiled code. However, raco exe can package code together with its run-time support to form an executable...

I also found that [`raco decompile`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/decompile.html) could decompile bytecode.

> The raco decompile command takes the path of a bytecode file (which usually has the file extension ".zo") or a source file with an associated bytecode file (usually created with raco make) and converts the bytecode file’s content back to an approximation of Racket code.

This is great. Now, my goal is clear. Find the bytecode embedded in the binary, then decompile the bytecode to understand what the program does.

#### Finding the bytecode

But the question is, where is the bytecode? To find out, I installed Racket on my Windows 10 VM, and tried out some commands with a simple Racket program.

```text
#lang racket

(define (extract str)
  (substring str 4 7))

(extract "the cat out of the bag")
```

First, I tried to compile the bytecode from source, then decompile it back to source. Just to make sure that things are working as how I expect them to.

```text
PS S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5> &"C:\Program Files\Racket\raco.exe" make -v hello.rkt
"hello.rkt":
  making #<path:S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5\hello.rkt>
 [output to "compiled\hello_rkt.zo"]
```

```text
PS S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5> &"C:\Program Files\Racket\raco.exe" decompile compiled/hello_rkt.zo
(module hello ....
  (require (lib "racket/main.rkt"))
  (provide)
  (define-values
   (extract)
   (begin
     '%%inline-variant%%
     (#%closed
      extract50
      (lambda (arg0-51)
        '#(extract
           #<path:S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5\compiled/hello.rkt>
    ...
```

Looks good. Now, to find the location of the bytecode in a binary.

1. Run `raco make` to build the bytecode.
2. Run `raco exe` to build an executable with the runtime and bytecode embedded in it.
3. Search for the bytecode generated in **Step 1** inside the executable generated in **Step 2**.

With **hello_rkt.zo** generated in **Step 1**, and **hello.exe** generated in **Step 2**, I first look at the contents in **hello_rkt.zo**.

```text

```

It seems to start with some magic values. Perhaps I could search for them in the executable.

```py
➜ python
Python 3.9.0 (default, Oct 27 2020, 14:15:17)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.21)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> bytecode = open("hello_rkt.zo", "rb").read()
>>> exe = open("hello.exe", "rb").read()
>>> hex(exe.index(bytecode[:10]))
'0x1a87e'
```

The bytecode probably is located at offset `0x1a87e` of the executable. Navigating to `0x41a87e` in Ghidra, I landed in the .rsrc section of the executable. This means that the bytecode is embedded as a [resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Windows)) in the executable. I used [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to extract the bytecode into **extracted.zo**.

Then, I ran `raco decompile` to decompile the extracted bytecode.

```text
PS S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5> &"C:\Program Files\Racket\raco.exe" decompile extracted.zo
(namespace-require '(only '#%kernel module))
```

Hmm? That's all? The decompiled code only has one line? What happened to my program?

**extracted.zo** is 7.3MB large. So there must be more content in this file. Maybe, there are many bytecode segments in this file.

```

There seems to be some small differences in the file header between **extracted.zo** and **hello_rkt.zo**. I'm hypothesizing that there are multiple bytecode files in **extracted.zo**. To get more ideas, I looked for the string used in my program to see where it is located in the executable.

```bash
➜ strings -t x extracted.zo | grep "cat out of the bag"
740a47 the cat out of the bag36
```

Oh, it is located quite far inside the file (at offset `0x740a47`). I decided to see whether there is any file header (`#~.7.8.racketD`) located near this string.

```py
Python 3.9.0 (default, Oct 27 2020, 14:15:17)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.21)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from binascii import unhexlify
>>> extracted = open("extracted.zo", "rb").read()
>>> hex(extracted.index(unhexlify("237e03372e38067261636b657444"), 0x740a47))
'0x740c87'
```

Turns out there is another file header after the string. How about before?

```py
>>> hex(extracted[:0x740a47].rfind(unhexlify("237e03372e38067261636b657444")))
'0x7408ba'
```

Not bad. There is another file header not far away before the string. I extracted the contents between the 2 file headers found above into **extracted-smaller.zo**. Then, I ran `raco decompile` on the file.

```py
>>> open("extracted-smaller.zo", "wb").write(extracted[0x7408ba:0x740c87])
```

```text
PS S:\RE Challenges\re-challenge-5> &"C:\Program Files\Racket\raco.exe" decompile extracted-smaller.zo
(module hello ....
  (require (lib "racket/main.rkt"))
  (provide)

   (extract)
   (begin
     '%%inline-variant%%
     (#%closed
      extract50
      (lambda (arg0-51)
        '#(extract
           #<path:s:\re challenges\re-challenge-5\hello.rkt>
           3
           0
           15
           44
           #f)
        '(flags: preserves-marks single-result)
        (substring arg0-51 '4 '7)))
     (#%closed
      extract49
      (lambda (arg0-55)
        '#(extract
           #<path:s:\re challenges\re-challenge-5\hello.rkt>
           3
           0
           15
           44
           #f)
        '(flags: preserves-marks single-result)
        (substring arg0-55 '4 '7)))))
  (#%apply-values print-values (substring '"the cat out of the bag" '4 '7))
  (void))
```

It works! I managed to
1. Extract the bytecode from an executable
2. Find the part of the bytecode that represents the actual program
3. Decompile the bytecode to recover the program source

### Reversing the challenge program

Now, I just need to replicate the steps above to get the Racket source code of the program given in this challenge. Doing so, I obtained the following code, which is quite long, with 840 lines of code.

```text
(module purple ....
  (require (lib "racket/main.rkt"))
  (provide)
  (define-values
   (trololol)
   '"1410130404451d141118050b155918051f1119161750000011120715400f1f1e170240021f1108190009115916020d021f1b10110009500f5e03030b191652040400501d17140b00181a155c0e0402171b15564500071b1e0f00030652110813151b06051e005c191d0208451f135204040050071b1e0b165c1c1c130915041c1d1e")
  (define-values
   (i-dunno-what-this-is)
   '"060e041600130d430212151901400b1a3e1842173a1c5518523e133d0240550a3e12110a561d5613")
  (define-values
   (omnonon)
   (string->bytes/utf-8
    (car
     (let ((local56
            (path->string (file-name-from-path (find-system-path 'run-file)))))
       (string-split.1 '#f '#t (#%sfs-clear local56) '".")))))
  (define-values
   (do-something-to-input)
   (#%closed
    do-something-to-input52
    (lambda (arg0-64)
      '#(do-something-to-input
         #<path:c:\users\angelystor\downloads\purple.rkt>
         9
         0
         544
         290
         #f)
      '(flags: preserves-marks single-result)
...
```

After watching this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4erGqF1Da8) on conditionals, loops and recursive functions in Racket lang, it is not too hard to understand what the program is doing. Also, about 50% of the code is repeated, so there is not too much to actually reverse. Perhaps code was duplicated by the compiler, or decompiler, or maybe just badly written by the program author?

Anyways, some examples of variables/functions include:

```text
(define-values
  (omnonon)
  (string->bytes/utf-8
    (car
      (let ((local56
          (path->string (file-name-from-path (find-system-path 'run-file)))))
        (string-split.1 '#f '#t (#%sfs-clear local56) '".")))))
```

`omnonon` is the program file name.

```text
(define-values
  (?lifted.0)
    (lambda (arg0-163)
      '#(...loads/purple.rkt:16:7
        #<path:c:\users\angelystor\downloads\purple.rkt>
        16
        7
        860
        43
        #t)
    '(captures: (val/ref #%globals) (string->number))
  (string->number (#%sfs-clear arg0-163) '16)))
```

`?lifted.0` is equivalent to `int(x, 16)` in Python.

Since the other functions are quite long, I shall omit them in this writeup. It is really not too difficult to understand anyways.

To summarize:
1. The program file name is used as the key to xor decrypt a constant string.
   * The decrypted string is expected to contain 9 comma-separated values, i.e. the string should contain 8 commas (e.g. `a,b,c,d,e,1,2,3,4`)
   * If the decrypted string does not fulfil the requirement above, the program complains that the file name is wrong and terminates.
2. If the file name is correct, a `key` containing 8 bytes is constructed from some of the values obtained from **Step 1**.
3. The `key` is used to xor decrypt another constant string, and the result is printed.
    * The constant string is `unhexlify("060e041600130d430212151901400b1a3e1842173a1c5518523e133d0240550a3e12110a561d5613")`

It seems that the first step is to change the program file name from `ctf.exe` to something that satisfies the requirement in **Step 1**. The program seems to be asking for the author's favourite potato colour. This information could be obtained from another OSINT challenge in this CTF. Changing the program file name to **purple.exe** gives the following output.

Key length looks okay... will this work?
#"s{wbAQN\awgfm@\2H^Km1c{^\26\\'K`IC\2\26NKgb~\27_\25W"
```

Some unreadable text is printed at the end of the program output. This is the string printed in **Step 3**.

With **purple.exe** as the file name, the key generated in **Step 2** is `uustABCD`. Decrypting the ciphertext with this key gives the following string, which is the same as the output above.

```py
>>> xor(unhexlify("060e041600130d430212151901400b1a3e1842173a1c5518523e133d0240550a3e12110a561d5613"), "uustABCD")
b"s{wbAQN\x07wgfm@\x02H^Km1c{^\x16\\'K`IC\x02\x16NKgb~\x17_\x15W"
```

Most likely, the key that was constructed in **Step 2** is incorrect, and I need to find the correct key to get the flag.

I know that the flag starts with `govtech-csg`. I also know that the key is 8-bytes long. So, I can xor `govtech-` with the encrypted flag to get the key.

```py
>>> from pwn import xor
>>> from binascii import unhexlify
>>> xor(unhexlify("060e041600130d430212151901400b1a3e1842173a1c5518523e133d0240550a3e12110a561d5613"), "govtech-")[:8]
b'aarbepen'
```

The key is `aarbepen`, and the flag is

```py
>>> xor(unhexlify("060e041600130d430212151901400b1a3e1842173a1c5518523e133d0240550a3e12110a561d5613"), "aarbepen")
b'govtech-csg{d0nt_y0u_l0v3_a_g00d_sch3m3}'
```

`govtech-csg{d0nt_y0u_l0v3_a_g00d_sch3m3}`
