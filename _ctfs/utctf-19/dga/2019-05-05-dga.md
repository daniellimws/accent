title: dga (re???)
ctf: UTCTF 2019
---

Only worked on this challenge 2 months after the CTF ended, here's the [file][dga] if you want to try.

## Basic information gathering
Upon running `strings` on the given file, we see the string `UPX` which tells us it is packed by UPX. We can easily unpack it by running

```bash
upx -d ./dga
```

When executing the binary, it just freezes without giving any output or responding to any input. Stopping it by pressing `ctrl+c` on the keyboard shows this interesting output.

```

  File "ssl.py", line 1077, in do_handshake

```

Run `strings` on the unpacked binary, and we see the string `MEIPASS`. This tells us that it is a [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) binary. `pyinstaller` is just a program that bundles a python script into a native binary, which can be either a PE or ELF file.

## Extract the original code
Ideally, we would want to obtain the original python code instead of looking at this bundled version. Upon some research, I found this [repository](https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker), which sadly only works for PE files, while we have an ELF file here.

Other than that, it turns out that `pyinstaller` comes with `pyi-archive_viewer` that lets us view the files in the bundle. So just run `pip install pyinstaller` to get it.

### Compressed files
Running `pyi-archive_viewer` on the unpacked binary gives the following

```
 pos, length, uncompressed, iscompressed, type, name
[(0, 245, 312, 1, 'm', 'struct'),
 (245, 1111, 1818, 1, 'm', 'pyimod01_os_path'),
 (1356, 4363, 9378, 1, 'm', 'pyimod02_archive'),
 (5719, 7386, 18683, 1, 'm', 'pyimod03_importers'),
 (13105, 1848, 4157, 1, 's', 'pyiboot01_bootstrap'),
 (14953, 210, 254, 1, 's', 'pyi_rth_pkgres'),
 (15163, 1077, 1774, 1, 's', 'pyi_rth_multiprocessing'),
 (16240, 465, 631, 1, 's', 'dga'),
 <truncated>
 (20600859, 4142389, 4142389, 0, 'z', 'PYZ-00.pyz')]
```

The 2 files that caught my attention were *dga* and *PYZ-00.pyz*, the former as it has the same name as our binary, and the latter as through some research I found that a *pyz* file is an archive of python bytecodes. The rest were *.so* files and therefore truncated in the output above.

`pyi-archive_viewer` allows us to extract these files by issuing the `x` command.

### Extract the pyc files from the pyz file
This step is just running scripts. Almost all the ones I found online were for PE files, but stumbled upon this [article](https://advancedpersistentjest.com/2016/07/31/manually-unpacking-pyinstaller-python-2p6/), that highlighted a script that was used to extract all the pyc files from the pyz file.

The steps applied to *PYZ-00.pyz* are quite straightforward in this script:
1. Save the magic number at the start of the *pyz* file. This magic number is to be used later for indicating the python version used in the file metadata.
2. Read the offset of the "table of contents", then load it into memory as a python dictionary.
3. Based on the table of contents, read data from the *pyz* file according to given offset and length, decompress it, then finally write it into a *pyc* file with the magic number saved in (1).

The table of contents looks like this. It can be viewed by running `pyi-archive_viewer PYZ-00.pyz`.

```
 Name: (ispkg, pos, len)
{'Crypto': (1, 17, 303),
 'Crypto.Cipher': (1, 320, 820),
 'Crypto.Cipher.AES': (0, 1140, 3400),
 'Crypto.Cipher.ARC2': (0, 4540, 2248),
 'Crypto.Cipher.DES': (0, 6788, 2125),
 'Crypto.Cipher.DES3': (0, 8913, 2666),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_cbc': (0, 11579, 2790),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_ccm': (0, 14369, 6660),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_cfb': (0, 21029, 2936),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_ctr': (0, 23965, 4341),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_eax': (0, 28306, 4600),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_ecb': (0, 32906, 2194),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_gcm': (0, 35100, 6909),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_ocb': (0, 42009, 5711),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_ofb': (0, 47720, 2743),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_openpgp': (0, 50463, 2161),
 'Crypto.Cipher._mode_siv': (0, 52624, 4580),
 'Crypto.Hash': (1, 57204, 184),
 ...
```

Not going to elaborate too much of the steps above, you can refer to this [script][unpack] if interested, the code is quite simple to understand. (Must use python3 as the challenge was bundled with the python3 version of pyinstaller)

Running this script yields a folder with 700+ pyc files, all of which are the libraries used by the program such as `Crypto`, `hashlib`, `http`...

### Decompile the extracted dga file
Well this doesn't tell us much about the challenge yet... Remember we extracted 2 files from the unpacked binary, *dga* and *PYZ-00.pyz*. Our main program logic should be inside *dga*.

*dga* contains bytecode for the program, however we cannot just run `uncompyle6` (a well known python bytecode decompiler) on it, as it is not in the right format (pyc format). 

How did I know *dga* contains bytecode for the main program? I just assumed and performed the following steps, and luckily it turned out to be true.

Recall when extracting from the *pyz* file we saved a magic number. Now we can prepend this magic number along with some file metadata to the *dga* file, so that it becomes a valid pyc file.

What's left is to run `uncompyle6` on the pyc file and we get the following code.

```py
# uncompyle6 version 2.11.5
# Python bytecode 3.6 (3379)
# Decompiled from: Python 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:17:52) 
# [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]
# Embedded file name: dga.py
from nistbeacon import NistBeacon
import time
import hashlib

def gen_domain():
    now = int(time.time())
    now -= 100000000
    record = NistBeacon.get_previous(now)
    val = record.output_value
    h = hashlib.md5()
    h.update(str(val).encode('utf-8'))
    res = h.digest()
    domain = ''
    for ch in res:
        tmp = (ch & 15) + (ch >> 4) + ord('a')
        if tmp <= ord('z'):
            domain += chr(tmp)

    domain += '.org'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    gen_domain()
```

## Solving the challenge?
I can't really remember what the challenge was asking for, but it was along the lines of generating a domain name based on a given timestamp. I think we just need to modify the function above and we will get the desired domain.
